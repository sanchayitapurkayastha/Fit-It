Online Shopping is an exponentially growig trend in today's world. With the boom of the e-commerce websites and the ease of availability in our smart phones, it is very easy to buy things from the Web. One of the most profitting e-commerce business is Garments. One gets the most fashionable clothes, from across different brands with reduced prices online. But a report made by Body Labs say that about 23% of all clothings get returned, and 64% of consumers say incorrect fit is the primary reason they return clothing.
